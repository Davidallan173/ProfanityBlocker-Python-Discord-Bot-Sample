# Profanity Blocker Sample Discord Bot

This application serves as an example on how ProfanityBlockers word filtering service could be implemented into a Discord bot. It is in no way "officially supported". 

This bot as well as self-created Discord bots are not eligible for the reduced priced plans (Discord Free and Discord Premium) and instead you should use ProfanityBlockers own [Discord bot] (https://www.profanity-blocker.co.uk/discord-word-filtering-bot/)

To use this bot, you need Python3.5 (as a minimum) installed. And then run the command
>pip3 install -r requirements.txt

This will install the required packages needed for this sample bot to run. 

To get a licence key, use [https://client.profanity-blocker.co.uk/] (https://client.profanity-blocker.co.uk/) (Pricing information can be found at [Here](https://www.profanity-blocker.co.uk/#pricing) )

Place your discord bot token in the config.json file, replacing the text that says "DiscordBotToken"

And place your ProfanityBlocker licence key in the same file, replacing the text that says "ProfanityBlockerLicence".

Once you have done all this, all you have to do is run the main.py file 
> python3 main.py

And then invite the bot to your discord server!
